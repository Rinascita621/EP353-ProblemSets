# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Plate Reverb

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a wavetable synthesizer.")

My project is about creating a plate reverb plugin that can be used in DAW like ableton, logic.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

In this project, I want to create a larger plate reverb. It will have parameters like size, dry/wet, decay time, width. These parameters can be customize. And I plan to preset a set of default values that can be applied as the plugin is opened. For all these parameters, I want to use knob to control them. Also the maximum percentage of dry/wet is 50% for each, size and width are 100%, decay time is 5s. If possible, I would like to use a landscape picture as the background of this plug-in to make the overall look and feel of the plug-in better. Hoping decay time is accurate to one decimal place. And you can enter values instead of just twisting the knob. The above are the effects I expected to achieve.

## If you are planning to combine EP-353's final project with another course's project, which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to EP-353, and which aspect(s) would connect to the other course?

maybe I will combine the plugin I will make in EP-353 with the final project of EP381 or EP341, if there's any chance. The final project of EP381 will be a scoring and sound design project, which means we need to write music ourselves so i might apply this reverb plugin to my scoring music or foley sound. For EP341, we gonna have a live perfomrance, if we can use ableton I will apply the reverb plugin to midi track for performing.

## In the software world, almost everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And it is not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The reverb plugin can be used on audio file.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The reverb plugin can be used in DAW.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The reverb plugin sounds bright, thick and splashy with good design and can be apply to my other final project. I hope this plug-in can make people feel convenient and comfortable to use.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

Searching how reverb plugins are made and experiment in Juce, discussing with professor about procedure or something we haven't coverd in class but will be useful in this project. Listening to different plate reverb and find out what makes the reverb sounds bright and thick. Learning how does plate reverb works. I also need to learn how to create a plugin in Juce, so far we only cover the how to apply these audio effect to audio files. I want to try these programming skill into plugin production to see if they will work in plugin.
